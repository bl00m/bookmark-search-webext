# Bookmark Search
A web extension to search thru your bookmarks directly from the address bar.

Works only with Firefox for now.

## Usage
Just type the keyword `!bm` followed by your search terms and suggestions will appear populated with the search results.

`!bm <search_terms>`

You can configure in which bookmark folders the extension will search.
